I'm sharing a simple script that tracks player positions in Rocket League using rlsdk_python and Frida. It prints the real-time coordinates of players in-game, making it a great tool for those wanting to understand player positioning or for use in bots and analysis scripts. Below, you'll find the complete script along with instructions on the required dependencies and how to set everything up.

Features:

Tracks real-time coordinates of all players in Rocket League.

Easy integration with RLSDK and Frida.

Can be extended for bots or custom analytics.

Requirements:
To get this script running, you'll need to install a few dependencies. Below are the requirements and how to install them.

Python (Recommended Version: Python 3.8 or above)

Make sure you're using a 64-bit version of Python, as Rocket League is a 64-bit application.

RLSDK Python Package
This package is required to interact with Rocket League's memory in real time. Install it using:

pip install rlsdk_python

Frida
Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit used for interacting with running applications, which is essential for this script.

pip install frida

Pywin32 (Optional, for Windows)
If you are using Windows and want to extend functionality for interacting with windows or input, you might need this package.

pip install pywin32

Setup Instructions:

Install Python: Download Python 3.8 or above from Python.org. Ensure it's the 64-bit version.

Install Dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the above pip commands to install all the necessary packages.

Launch Rocket League: Make sure Rocket League is running before you start the script.

Run the Script: Save the above script as rl_offsets.py and run it using Python:

python rl_offsets.py > or python copy paste localization

Observe Player Positions: The console will display the coordinates of every player in real-time.

Potential Issues:

Permission Errors: If you encounter a PermissionDeniedError when attaching with Frida, try running the command prompt as Administrator.

Frida Issues: Ensure Frida is compatible with your Python version. A 64-bit Python is required.

Usage Tips:

The script is set up to track player positions, but you can extend it to control car movement or add custom logic for bot behavior.

You can also add more event listeners using rlsdk_python to explore additional aspects of the game's memory.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you face any issues setting this up. I'm here to help!

Happy hacking!
